# KnockDetection
Detect knock event for android device, it can detect the knock times and tell user to do something.

You can use this interface to do something cool, like knock you phone twice to play next song even though
your smartphone in your pocket.

The orignal project is: http://kybdp.github.io/KnockKnock/

I just find this project and fixed something. Thanks the orignal project's author Geir Turtum and Torgeir Lien.

In my project, you can knock your phone, the app will tell you the times you knocked by toast.
If your phone is playing a song in background, knock three times will pause the music player or continue playing.
Give you a button to stop/start the knock event detecting, because the detecting will consume a large amount of resources.
